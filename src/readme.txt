== Installation ==

Though the Hyperdrive beta was made available in the WordPress Plugin gallery temporarily, the number of installations grew so fast we had to temporarily disengage our thrusters. We want to ensure your Hyperdrive experience is a positive one from the start and that you have a safe flight.

In the meanwhile, you can install the Hypderdrive beta in the following ways to gain access to our thrusters:

= Automatic Transmission =

If you have Composer installed on your WordPress site you can install Hyperdrive automatically by running the following command sequence:

1. Install with `composer require vhs/hyperdrive` from a terminal connected to your WordPress site.
2. Activate the plugin through the *Plugins* menu in WordPress.

If you have any issues with this approach, please [let engineering know](https://codeberg.org/vhs/hyperdrive/issues/new).

= Manual Transmission =

If you experience any issues with automatic installation, or would prefer to install the plugin manually, simply:

1. Upload `hyperdrive.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory,
2. Activate the plugin through the *Plugins* menu in WordPress.
