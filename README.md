# Todo before 1.0.0 release

- [ ] Only dequeue scripts if [browser supports Fetch](http://caniuse.com/#search=fetch) for backwards compatibility with older browsers
- [ ] Integrate localization behaviors [as shown here](https://gist.github.com/vhs/64e8380010e43a526fb9c9ee511fad17#file-functions-php-L507).
- [ ] Test with a few different themes and open bugs and needed

# Post 1.0.0 roadmap

- [ ] Integrate User Interface created by [@wedangsu](https://github.com/wedangsusu)
- [ ] Ensure interface gives ability to defer script execution for scripts querying the DOM until after the DOM is fully parsed.
- [ ] Give ability to perform grouping, so non-jQuery scripts can download and execute without waiting for jQuery.
- [ ] Add ability to load icon fonts and [non-critical CSS](https://gist.github.com/scottjehl/87176715419617ae6994) (also possible with Fetch Inject)
- [ ] Build API enabling theme authors greater control

# How it works

Hyperdrive uses a performance optimization technique known as [Fetch Injection](https://hackcabin.com/post/managing-async-dependencies-javascript/), available in [browsers with support](http://caniuse.com/#search=fetch) for the Fetch API. Fetch is a modern replacement for Ajax.
